## 🚀  Full-Stack Software Developer

I’m a Full-Stack Software Developer passionate about building reliable, scalable, and user-focused applications. My background in business and financial analysis gives me a unique perspective: I design solutions that not only work technically, but also create real business value.

I have experience delivering end-to-end applications with technologies like `Python` (`FastAPI`, `Django`), `React`, and `PostgreSQL`, while also exploring how AI and automation can enhance products. From designing secure APIs and data models to developing modern frontends, I aim to bridge engineering with practical impact.

**What I build:**

- **Full-Stack Applications:** Robust platforms from backend to frontend.

- **AI-Powered Features:** Integrating intelligent workflows and automation into real products.

- **APIs & Data Systems:** Secure, scalable services and data pipelines.

- **User Interfaces:** Clean, responsive, and user-friendly frontends.
