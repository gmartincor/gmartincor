## 🚀 AI Engineer & Full-Stack Developer

I bridge the gap between complex business challenges and intelligent automation. With a background in financial analysis, I focus on the strategic "why" behind every technical solution, ensuring that AI systems deliver tangible results.

My core expertise is architecting and deploying autonomous AI agents using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**. I build these intelligent cores on a solid full-stack foundation of `Python` (`FastAPI`, `Django`), `React`, and `PostgreSQL`, creating robust, end-to-end applications.

**What I build:**
- **Autonomous Agents:** Designing and implementing multi-agent workflows for tasks like research, data analysis, and process automation.
- **Scalable APIs:** Engineering secure and efficient APIs that serve as the backbone for AI-powered services.
- **Full-Stack Solutions:** Integrating AI models into seamless user-facing applications with modern front-ends.
